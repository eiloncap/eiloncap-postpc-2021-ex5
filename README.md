# Question:
We didn't define any UX flow to let users edit a description on an existing TODO item.
Which UX flow will you define?

# Answer:
We can add a tool bar at the top of the activity with buttons that switches to "edit mode" in which
a click on each task will make it editable.
Alternatively, an edit button for each task can appear only after long click with the delete button,
the implementation won't be hard because the delete button already exists.
